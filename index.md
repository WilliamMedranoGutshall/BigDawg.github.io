### Code Review:
     Code review is the use of a person or automation to assist in the finding of errors, bad design, and opportunities for improvement. Software development is done by people and thus is prone to mistakes and bugs. As a programmer writing code, we create an emotional attachment to our work and want to believe that our work is correct. Developers also have an insight into the thought process that went into the design and development which means that things that seem clear to the person who wrote the code won’t necessarily seem clear to someone else. This means that as the developer of the code, we are more likely to overlook errors and design flaws, which is why it is crucial to bring in someone else to review the code. Even if the code has been completely debugged and is 100% functional and meets the requirements, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the code meets quality standards. Developers typically work in groups with each person taking on different portions, and code needs to be able to be modified for future changes or expansions. This means that it is also important that the code be simple for another developer to understand and change if necessary. It is extremely difficult for a developer to make this determination on their own, which is why code review is crucial to group development as well.
